# GPU SuperCluster Calculator Security Guide

## Current Security Vulnerabilities

Your calculator currently exposes ALL business logic in the client-side JavaScript:
- All GPU pricing data
- Power consumption formulas
- TCO calculation algorithms
- Storage vendor pricing
- Network cost calculations
- All proprietary formulas and coefficients

Anyone can:
1. Open browser DevTools
2. View Sources → find your React component
3. Copy all your calculation logic and data

## Security Solutions

### 1. **Quick Fix: Code Obfuscation (Minimal Protection)**
Already implemented:
- Disabled source maps in production builds
- Code is minified and harder to read
- **Protection Level: Low** - Determined users can still reverse-engineer

### 2. **Backend API Approach (Recommended)**
Move all calculations to a secure backend:
- Created `calculator-api.py` with Flask
- All formulas and data stay on server
- Client only sends inputs and receives results
- **Protection Level: High** - Business logic completely hidden

To implement:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors gunicorn

# Run API server
python calculator-api.py

# For production, use:
gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:7778 calculator-api:app
```

### 3. **Additional Security Measures**

#### A. Environment Variables
```bash
# Create .env file for React
REACT_APP_CALCULATOR_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
REACT_APP_CALCULATOR_API_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

#### B. API Security Features
- Rate limiting (10 requests/minute per IP)
- Request signature validation
- CORS restricted to your domain
- Input validation and sanitization

#### C. Nginx Configuration (for API)
```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7778;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    
    # Rate limiting
    limit_req zone=api_limit burst=10 nodelay;
}
```

#### D. Code Splitting
Split sensitive components into lazy-loaded chunks:
```javascript
const Calculator = lazy(() => import('./GPUSuperclusterCalculatorSecure'));
```

### 4. **Legal Protection**
Add to your terms of service:
- Copyright notice on calculations
- Prohibition of reverse engineering
- Legal consequences for IP theft

### 5. **Monitoring & Detection**
- Log unusual API usage patterns
- Monitor for automated scraping
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Enable production build without source maps ✓
2. **High Priority**: Deploy backend API (1-2 days)
3. **Medium Priority**: Add legal protections
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor and update security measures

## Testing the Secure Version

1. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python calculator-api.py
   ```

2. Update React app to use secure component:
   ```javascript
   // In App.tsx, replace:
   import { GPUSuperclusterCalculator } from './components/features/GPUSuperclusterCalculator';
   
   // With:
   import { GPUSuperclusterCalculatorSecure } from './components/features/GPUSuperclusterCalculatorSecure';
   ```

3. Build and deploy with security enabled

## Important Notes

- The current implementation still exposes data in the UI
- For maximum security, also limit what data is shown
- Consider adding user authentication for access control
- Regular security audits recommended

## Emergency Response

If your IP is compromised:
1. Immediately change all calculations slightly
2. Update legal documentation
3. Monitor for unauthorized commercial use
4. Consider DMCA takedown requests if copied

Remember: No client-side solution is 100% secure. The only way to truly protect your algorithms is to keep them server-side.
